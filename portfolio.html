    <h2> This project demonstrated our use of while loops, the movement of figures, and changing the color of said figure. For this project my partner and I created the solar system in python with the different planets in order. They all varied in sizes and shapes. Unfortunately we weren't able to make it move, but in retrospect it over shows a very basic representation of the solar system<h2>

    <h2> This project was a game we made that demonstrated the use of while loops, moving figures, and if when statemennts. This game is a race where two players compete to get to the end of the maze first. Both players start in the center of the maze, one player uses the arrow keys and the second uses the wasd keys. Both are at an equal standing in the beginning because a random map shows up each time you play<h2>

    <h2> This project demonstrated our use of procedures, animation, events, change of costumes, sounds, lists, and multiple backgrounds to create a simple interactive scratch game where a shark is swimming and eating the fish. The player accumulates points by how many fish are eaten in a 60-second window.</h2>
